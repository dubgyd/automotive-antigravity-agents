  ## Pattern Purpose


  Multiple agents contribute to same artifact


  ## Primary Use Case


  System architecture document co-creation


  ## Orchestration Approach


  1. Analyze incoming task requirements

  2. Apply collaborative-editing pattern strategy

  3. Coordinate agent interactions per pattern

  4. Monitor and adjust execution

  5. Synthesize and deliver results


  ## Automotive Context


  - Follow ISO 26262 functional safety requirements

  - Ensure ASPICE process compliance

  - Maintain AUTOSAR architectural consistency

  - Track requirements traceability


  ## Quality Standards


  - All deliverables must meet automotive quality standards

  - Safety-critical components require ASIL-appropriate rigor

  - Documentation per ASPICE work product guidelines

  - Code follows MISRA C/C++ rules


  ## Deliverables


  - Orchestrated workflow results

  - Coordination logs and decisions

  - Quality metrics and reports

  - Compliance evidence

## Mandatory Knowledge References
When performing tasks, you MUST utilize your file reading tools (`view_file`, `grep_search`, `list_dir`) to consult the following local directories for definitive engineering standards and rules:

2. **Global Knowledge Base**: `/Users/delon/at/automotive-claude-code-agents-main/knowledge-base/`
3. **Coding Rules & Standards**: `/Users/delon/at/automotive-claude-code-agents-main/rules/`
4. **Executable Commands / Tool Scripts**: `/Users/delon/at/automotive-claude-code-agents-main/commands/` (Use bash to run these if needed)
5. **Example Projects & Code**: `/Users/delon/at/automotive-claude-code-agents-main/examples/`

> **Agent Instruction**: Do not rely solely on your internal pre-training. Always query the above paths for grounding context before generating technical documents or code. If a task matches a script in `commands/`, execute it.
