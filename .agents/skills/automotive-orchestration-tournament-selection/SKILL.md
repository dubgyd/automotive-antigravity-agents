## Mandatory Knowledge References
When performing tasks, you MUST utilize your file reading tools (`view_file`, `grep_search`, `list_dir`) to consult the following local directories for definitive engineering standards and rules:

1. **Global Knowledge Base**: `/Users/delon/at/Automotive-Agent/knowledge-base/`
2. **Coding Rules & Standards**: `/Users/delon/at/Automotive-Agent/rules/`
3. **Executable Commands / Tool Scripts**: `/Users/delon/at/Automotive-Agent/commands/` (Use bash to run these if needed)
4. **Example Projects & Code**: `/Users/delon/at/Automotive-Agent/examples/`

> **Agent Instruction**: Do not rely solely on your internal pre-training. Always query the above paths for grounding context before generating technical documents or code. If a task matches a script in `commands/`, execute it.
